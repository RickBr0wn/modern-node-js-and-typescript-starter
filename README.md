# Modern Node.js & Typescript starter

[![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)]()

This is a starter for speeding up the development process in creating modern Node.js apps using typescript. Modern Node.js allows us developers to use `ES6` features such as `import/export`, and the `async/await` keywords.

## 🚀 Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### 🧳 Prerequisites

To get this starter running locally you will need:

- a node package manager (yarn or npm)
- a command line terminal (iTerm or bash)
- your favorite IDE (vscode, sublime)

### 💻 Installing

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RickBr0wn/modern-node-js-and-typescript-starter <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME> && cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
```

To start your own repository,

> **important:** make sure you are in the cloned directory.

```bash
rm -rf .git
git init

git add .
git commit -m 'initial commit'
```

This will remove the existing git history, and allow you to link it to a new repository.

> Please credit this starter if you build something fantastic!
